This is what happens when you realize that just solving "Ninety Nine Lisp
Problems" is not fun enough so you decide to cobble together your own
Lisp that is sufficient to execute the solutions for those problems.

It is R5RS*-ish*, and it's not meant to be production-grade, stable, secure,
maintainable, intelligible, following the best practices, or really anything at
all (except fun to code).
